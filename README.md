##### PROJECT INTENT
  > 1. The first and main reason of why I have started this project is to self-PR. The year of 2023 has become a very difficult for my family. I have lost my job as company where I use to work for 14 years has left Russia due to the sanctions and restrictions applied to RF after begining the war in Ukrane. 
  Once I start looking for a job I realized that most of the modern employees check if candidate have a projects on GitHub for to demonstrate skils and knowledge written in CV.
  > 2. The company where I used to work for 14 years is the one of the top 10 world leaders in EPCMF. So during the years I have lernt very well CAD systems and gain passion in Geo-spatial technologies. 
  > 3. I'm living in Far-East region of Russia, unfortunatelly Earthquackes and Tsunamy are not an empty words for us. I have one app on my iphone which helps me to monitor current situation but honestly speaking this app isn't fully satisfy me, thus I decided to make my own app by using my knowledge in Geo-spatial, geojson google earth and online services API's. Besides that I would like this app to be a cross platform that is why I choose to go with .NET MAUI.

I'm not promissing you that this is going to be a fast forward project, as there are a lot of techniques I would like to implement in this project such as clean-code architecture, test-driven and domain-driven development. Besides that I have applied to Data Scientist in AI and ML degree which going to be my number one priority

So please be patience and whish me to break a leg.

I hope you will enjoy my code and find it helfull for your own ideas.

Best regards,

Maksim Viktorovich Zaikin aka [MVZ]
